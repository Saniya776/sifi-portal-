🌌 Sci-Fi Portal – Blender Animation (Tecnosis 2024 Trailer)

This project features a 3D sci-fi portal animation created in Blender for the official trailer of Tecnosis 2024, the annual technical fest of my college held in November 2024. The portal served as a key cinematic visual element and contributed to the futuristic theme of the trailer.

I also edited and designed the end credits that appear at the end of the same trailer.
